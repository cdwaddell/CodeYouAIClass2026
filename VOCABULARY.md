Vocabulary List
1. AI Agent
A software program that can autonomously perceive its environment, reason about information, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

2. Large Language Model (LLM)
A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text, serving as the "brain" of an AI agent.

3. LangChain
A framework for developing applications powered by language models, providing tools for building chains, agents, and integrations with various data sources and APIs.

4. Semantic Kernel
A lightweight software development kit (SDK) from Microsoft for integrating AI capabilities into applications through plugins, planners, and semantic functions.

5. Orchestration
The coordination of multiple tools, functions, and decision-making logic within an AI agent to accomplish complex tasks.

6. Plugin
A collection of functions or capabilities that an AI agent can use to perform specific tasks or access external services.

7. Prompt Engineering
The practice of designing and crafting effective instructions, context, and examples to guide an AI model toward producing desired outputs.

8. Chain
A sequence of calls to language models or other utilities that process information in a specific order to achieve a result.

9. Tool
A specific function or capability that an AI agent can invoke to perform actions such as searching databases, calling APIs, or performing calculations.

10. Memory
A component of an AI agent that stores conversation history, context, and state information to maintain continuity across interactions.

11. Few-Shot Learning
A technique where examples of desired behavior are provided in the prompt to guide the AI model's responses.

12. Planner
A component that automatically breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps that an agent can execute sequentially.

13. Token
The basic unit of text that language models process, typically representing a word, part of a word, or punctuation mark. Token usage affects API costs.

14. Vector Database
A specialized database that stores data as numerical vectors, enabling efficient similarity searches for AI applications, often used for long-term memory.

15. Semantic Function
In Semantic Kernel, a function defined using natural language prompts rather than traditional code.

16. Native Function
A traditional code function written in a programming language that can be made accessible to an AI agent.

17. Guardrails
Safety measures and constraints implemented to control AI agent behavior, prevent harmful outputs, and manage resource usage.

18. Autonomous
Operating independently without human intervention, able to make decisions and take actions on its own.

19. API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

20. Rate Limiting
A technique to control the frequency of API requests or actions to prevent excessive usage and manage costs.

21. Schema
A structured definition of the expected format, data types, and parameters for inputs and outputs.

22. Boilerplate Code
Standard, repetitive code that serves as a template or starting point for common programming tasks.

23. Async/Await
A programming pattern for handling asynchronous operations, allowing code to wait for tasks to complete without blocking execution.

24. Inference
The process of using a trained AI model to generate predictions, responses, or outputs based on input data.

25. Context Window
The maximum amount of text (in tokens) that a language model can process at one time, including both input and output.

26. Hallucination
When an AI model generates information that appears plausible but is factually incorrect or fabricated.

27. Sanitization
The process of cleaning and validating input data to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.

28. SDK (Software Development Kit)
A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to create applications for a specific platform or framework.

29. Microservices
An architectural approach where applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other.

30. Retrieval
The process of fetching relevant information from a database or knowledge base in response to a query.
